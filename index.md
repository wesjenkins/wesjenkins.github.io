## Welcome to my Coding Handbook

This page is designed to give somewhat brief overviews of as many languages as possible.
The idea is that these pages are are for quickly getting up to speed with a language you haven't used in a while.
(By you, I mostly mean me. These pages are mostly for me when I need to remember some feature I haven't used in a while)

It's easier to put it all in one place than search around for docs every time you forget.
